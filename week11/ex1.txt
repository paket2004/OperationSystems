Lines 1-9 are obtained by running ex1.c program with changing of the chroot.
Difference between the outputs is the different root directories for execution of C program. We use chroot to change the root directory to ./lofsdisk. As a result, it sees the content within that directory 
as if it were the root directory of the filesystem. As an output we obtain a content in chroot environment.
Without chroot the program just sees the actual root directory of the file system
